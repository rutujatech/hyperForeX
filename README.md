Project Description

Hyper ForeX
• The Cross-Border Payment Platform is a blockchain-based solution developed using 
Hyperledger Fabric technology. It aims to address the challenges and inefficiencies 
associated with cross-border payments, such as high transaction costs, long settlement 
times, and lack of transparency. By leveraging the decentralized and immutable 
nature of blockchain, the platform provides a secure, efficient, and transparent 
mechanism for conducting cross-border transactions.
